# JavaScript Project - Morse Code Translator

---

<!-- _class: activity -->

## Overview

You’re tasked with creating a morse code translator using tests. It should be able to translate based on user input from the DOM. <br/><br/>
This should allow users to type English words/sentences into an input box and receive the
morse code translation. Consider how you will store the morse characters in TS to make
translation easier.<br/><br/>
All of your functions should be tested, with the tests.<br/><br/>
Remember to make a plan/pseudocode before diving right in.<br/><br/>
As an extension it should be able to translate both ways.<br/><br/>
The logic for translating both ways won’t be exactly the same but might there might be
similarities between the two translators (Morse => English, English => Morse).<br/><br/>

## Goals

1. <span class="underline">A working Translator:</span> The main task is to create a tested Translator not only will this test your understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.
2. <span class="underline">Practice using Git and GitHub flow:</span> We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line... so REGULAR COMMITS :D
3. <span class="underline">Apply what you are learning:</span> This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

## Requirements

- Translator functions and Unit tests to be written in separate files. Functions to be brought into the main.js and unit test files.
- You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub.
  - In the repo you will also need a [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README).md with a short intro to the project.
  - We expect at least **10 Git commits** for the different stages in your development.
- Beware of following a “How to.. JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not the same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have covered so If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it.
- We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to work on different device widths.
